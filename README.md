# guessGame
Guessing game in python my first Python game

# how to run
Just download this code and have python3 version installed 
Open and run this file in terminal or cmd or using python idle to play the game 

# Textual based interface with guessing as main mechanics for play

# future scope 
maybe a GUI interface to take inputs of any other graphical changes like dice games or many other that have randomness .This is just first step .
